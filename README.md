# Metal Slug Resources

This repository aims to help anyone building a 2D run and gun game in Unity similar to Metal Slug. 

I researched and collected a large amount of resources from many websites and some of them are available here in the `Resources` folder. 
The resources are of various types like sprite sheets, audios, fonts, etc. 

Here are two websites that contain many game sprites and other resources: 
- Spriters Resource [Link](https://www.spriters-resource.com/)
- Sprite Database [Link](https://spritedatabase.net/)

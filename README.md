# Metal Slug Resources

This repository aims to help anyone building a 2D run and gun game in Unity similar to Metal Slug. 

I researched and collected a large amount of resources from many websites and some of them are available here in the `Resources` folder. 
The resources are of various types like sprite sheets, audios, fonts, etc. 

Here are two websites that contain many game sprites and other resources:
